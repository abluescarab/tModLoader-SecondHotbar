!!! WARNING !!!
Remove all items from the extra hotbar before disabling this mod!

---

Based in part on Solo-Ion's Hotbar Swapper, Second Hotbar is a mod that (what else?) adds a second hotbar to your inventory screen. This allows the bottom row of the inventory to be used for any items without worrying about arranging them correctly.

* Place items in the desired slot on the second hotbar.
* Press Tab to swap the main hotbar and second hotbar.
* Press Alt plus a hotbar key (default 1-9 and 0) to swap a single item.
* Keys can be changed in the Controls screen.

[Known Issues]
* Multi-colored items, such as gels, appear grey in the added slots
* No tooltip on hover

[Credits]
* Solo-Ion for his original Hotbar Swapper mod
* jopojelly for his SaveCustomData/ReadCustomData code for custom slots
* rsw0x for the fix in v1.0.3
